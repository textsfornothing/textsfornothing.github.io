<p>Climate change is an existential threat to human civilization. We've known about it for decades, yet carbon emissions have doubled over the past 30 years. Business as usual is no longer possible.</p>

<p>We have a choice to make. We can choose a rapid, controlled transition to a zero-emission economy, including major emission reductions within the next decade, or we can choose disaster. Those are the options.</p>

<h2>Facts</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/peter-frumhoff/global-warming-fact-co2-emissions-since-1988-764">More than half</a> of all industrial-era carbon emissions have happened since 1988. 71% of all emissions since 1988 can be traced to just <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/media/new-report-shows-just-100-companies-are-source-of-over-70-of-emissions">100 state and commercial fossil fuel producers</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/18/infographics.htm">Emissions are still increasing</a>. After a plateau in 2014-2016, global emissions increased in 2017 and again in 2018, reaching a record high.</p>

<p>The next decade is critical. According to the IPCC, we need to reduce emissions by at least <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/10/08/world-has-only-years-get-climate-change-under-control-un-scientists-say/?noredirect=on">45% by 2030</a> to prevent catastrophe. This is still possible, but it requires <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report">radical action</a>.</p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><a href="https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blog/Well-Under-2-Degrees-Celsius-Report-2017.pdf">Here's what we need to do:</a>
<ul>
  <li>Cut short-lived climate pollutants (black carbon, methane, HFCs) to the maximum extent possible by 2030.</li>
  <li>Decarbonize the global energy system with renewables and efficiency improvements, so that emissions peak by 2020 and decline to net zero by 2050.</li>
  <li>Remove carbon from the atmosphere, using techniques such as afforestation and carbon capture, over the rest of the century.</li>
</p>
</ul>

<p>The good news is that <a href="https://www.drawdown.org/">it can be done</a>.</p>

<!--<p>An <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/15/immediate-fossil-fuel-phaseout-could-arrest-climate-change-study">immediate fossil fuel phaseout, starting now</a>, would likely keep us under 1.5&#176;C. This requires that &ldquo;all fossil fuel infrastructure&mdash;power plants, factories, vehicles, ships and planes&mdash;from now on are replaced by zero-carbon alternatives at the end of their useful lives.&rdquo;</p>-->

<!--<p>Significant improvements to <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/world-can-limit-global-warming-one-point-five-improving-energy-efficiency">energy efficiency</a> can also play a major role.</p>-->

<p>The solutions are <a href="https://www.theclimatemobilization.org/solution">ambitious, but not impossible</a>. More to the point, they are not optional. This is what we need to do.</p>

<h2>Canada</h2>

<p>Canada is responsible for <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html">1.6% of global emissions</a>.

<p>Canada's annual emissions have increased by 19% since 1990. <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/05/21/analysis/canada-vs-uk-lessons-climate-fight">The UK's emissions <em>decreased</em> by 41%</a> over the same period. Canada's emissions are now 50% higher than the UK's, even though the UK has a larger economy and almost twice as many people.</p>

<p>Alberta and Saskatchewan have increased their emissions by 17% since 2005, mostly due to an increase in emissions from the tar sands. The rest of Canada decreased its emissions by 15% over the same period, with Ontario leading the way (mainly by eliminating coal). <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/05/27/analysis/surprise-most-canada-track-hit-our-2020-climate-target">Alberta and Saskatchewan are now responsible for half of Canada's emissions.</a></p>

<p>Canada currently gives out about <a href="https://www.iisd.org/faq/unpacking-canadas-fossil-fuel-subsidies/">$3.3 billion in subsidies</a> to oil and gas producers. This includes tax breaks as well as direct cash infusions. It does not include the federal government's $4.5 billion purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline in 2018.</p>

<p>The transition away from fossil fuels will likely lead to a sharp decline in demand by 2035. This will have a <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4253559/canada-alberta-oilsands-financial-crisis-carbon-bubble/">devastating impact</a> on Canada's fossil fuel industry and on the economy as a whole.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://cleanenergycanada.org/report/missing-the-bigger-picture/">Canada's clean energy sector</a> already employs 298,000 people and is growing faster than the rest of the economy.</p>
