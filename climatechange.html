<p>We've had 30 years to deal with climate change. Instead, carbon emissions have doubled. Business as usual is no longer possible&mdash;at most, we get a few more decades before things start to collapse. We can choose a rapid, controlled transition to a zero-emission economy, or we can choose disaster. Those are the options.</p>

<h2>Facts</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/peter-frumhoff/global-warming-fact-co2-emissions-since-1988-764">More than half</a> of all industrial-era carbon emissions have happened since 1988, when the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">IPCC</a> was founded. 71% of all emissions since 1988 can be traced to just <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/media/new-report-shows-just-100-companies-are-source-of-over-70-of-emissions">100 state and commercial fossil fuel producers</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/18/infographics.htm">Emissions are still increasing</a>. After a plateau in 2014-2016, global emissions increased in 2017 and again in 2018, reaching a record high.</p>

<p>The next decade is critical. According to the IPCC, we need to reduce emissions by at least <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/10/08/world-has-only-years-get-climate-change-under-control-un-scientists-say/?noredirect=on">45% by 2030</a> to prevent catastrophe. This is still possible, but it requires <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report">radical action</a>.</p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.drawdown.org/">We can stop climate change.</a></p>

<p>An <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/15/immediate-fossil-fuel-phaseout-could-arrest-climate-change-study">immediate fossil fuel phaseout, starting now</a>, would likely keep us under 1.5&#176;C. This requires that &ldquo;all fossil fuel infrastructure&mdash;power plants, factories, vehicles, ships and planes&mdash;from now on are replaced by zero-carbon alternatives at the end of their useful lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Significant improvements to <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/world-can-limit-global-warming-one-point-five-improving-energy-efficiency">energy efficiency</a> can also play a major role.</p>

<p>The solutions are ambitious, but not impossible. What happens next is up to us.</p>

<h2>Canada</h2>

<p>Canada is responsible for <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html">1.6% of global emissions</a>.

<p>Canada's annual emissions have increased by 19% since 1990. <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/05/21/analysis/canada-vs-uk-lessons-climate-fight">The UK's emissions <em>decreased</em> by 41%</a> over the same period. Canada's emissions are now 50% higher than the UK's, even though the UK has a larger economy and almost twice as many people.</p>

<p>Alberta and Saskatchewan have increased their emissions by 17% since 2005, mostly due to an increase in emissions from the tar sands. The rest of Canada decreased its emissions by 15% over the same period, with Ontario leading the way (mainly by eliminating coal). <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/05/27/analysis/surprise-most-canada-track-hit-our-2020-climate-target">Alberta and Saskatchewan are now responsible for half of Canada's emissions.</a></p>

<p>Canada currently gives out about <a href="https://www.iisd.org/faq/unpacking-canadas-fossil-fuel-subsidies/">$3.3 billion in subsidies</a> to oil and gas producers. This includes tax breaks as well as direct cash infusions. It does not include the federal government's $4.5 billion purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline in 2018.</p>

<p>The transition away from fossil fuels will likely lead to a sharp decline in demand by 2035. This will have a <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4253559/canada-alberta-oilsands-financial-crisis-carbon-bubble/">devastating impact</a> on Canada's fossil fuel industry and on the economy as a whole.</p>
